            <h3 class="title">Scope In India</h3>
        
            <ul>
                <li>India is a bioinformatics newcomer with a plethora of expertise in cell biology, biochemistry, and plant and animal physiology. Bioinformatics, as the most recent addition, has a long way to go.</li>
                <li>Salaries for entry-level job seekers and experienced workers might differ significantly. It can go as high as 3-4 LPA for data analysts, 4-6 LPA for programmers, and 7-10 LPA for high-grade scientists.</li>
                <li>In general, India has the most affordable resources for learning bioinformatics. Students with a desire to serve their country can study in India and find suitable careers. It is also appropriate to offer shots here to financially disadvantaged pupils in order to brighten their careers.</li>
                <li>In the next 20 years, the integration of technology and data influx is predicted to increase in every science sector. As a result, bioinformatics has a bright future in India.</li>
              
            </ul>

        <div class="box">
            <h3 class="title">Scope In Abroad</h3>
        
            <ul>
                <li>Other countries, particularly developed countries, have already delved deeper into bioinformatics. When compared to developing countries, they are well ahead in terms of research and scientific advancements.</li>
                <li>For example, international institutions built the NCBI, EMBL, and DDBJ repositories decades ago. They serve as a source of information retrieval for scientists all across the world.</li>
                <li>Salary is an important factor to consider. The majority of PhD scholars earn between $24,000 and $30,000 per year. This can differ from one country to the next. Freshmen are anticipated to be paid similarly.</li>
                <li>Bioinformatics has a huge number of job opportunities in other countries than india. It's challenging to get a job and compete against the best prospects in the world. The expense of living is prohibitively high in abroad.</li>
